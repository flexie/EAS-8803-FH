    "text": "The assignments require Julia and Python 3 to be installed (Python 2 will not work).\nFor Windows, I recommend to use docker as Devito does not support Windows.\n\n\nTo install julia follow\nhttps://julialang.org/downloads/\nAnd install Julia 1.5\n\n\n\nThe recommended installation is via conda to have a stable environment.\nhttps://conda.io/miniconda.html\n\n\n\nFor the assignments, you will need a few python and julia packages. Please follow these instructions to install all of the packages in the order described here.\nFirst, install Devito using pip (or pip3), or see the Devito’s GitHub page for installation with Conda and further information. The current release of JUDI requires Python 3 and the current Devito version. Run all of the following commands from the (bash) terminal command line (not in the Julia REPL):\npip install --user git+https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git\nThen install matplotlib by\npip install matplotlib\nIf these commands don’t work, please replace pip by pip3 and try it again.\nFor reading and writing seismic SEG-Y data, JUDI uses the SegyIO package and matrix-free linear operators are based the Julia Operator LIbrary (JOLI), we can install these 2 packages via:\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl.git\")'\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JOLI.jl.git\")'\nOnce Devito, SegyIO and JOLI are installed, you can install JUDI with Julia’s Pkg.add.\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl\")'\nOnce you have JUDI installed, you need to point Julia’s PyCall package to the Python version for which we previously installed Devito. To do this, copy-paste the following commands into the (bash) terminal:\nexport PYTHON=$(which python)\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(\"PyCall\")'\nAgain, try which python3 if which python does not work.\nYou can verify your installation by running:\njulia -e 'using Pkg; using JUDI; example=joinpath(dirname(pathof(JUDI)),\"..\",\"examples/scripts/modeling_basic_2D.jl\");include(example);'\nThis command should finish without errors.\n\n\n\nDocker is a platform which builds a virtual machine/container for you in case some softwares above cannot be installed/processed in the environment on your local machine. Thus, we suggest you first try to install the softwares above and do the programming exercises on your local machine. The exercises should work well in apple/linux machines.

Please follow these instructions to install all of the packages in the order described here.\nFirst, install Devito using pip (or pip3), or see the Devito’s GitHub page for installation with Conda and further information. The current release of JUDI requires Python 3 and the current Devito version. Run all of the following commands from the (bash) terminal command line (not in the Julia REPL):\npip install --user git+https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git\nThen install matplotlib by\npip install matplotlib\nIf these commands don’t work, please replace pip by pip3 and try it again.\nFor reading and writing seismic SEG-Y data, JUDI uses the SegyIO package and matrix-free linear operators are based the Julia Operator LIbrary (JOLI), we can install these 2 packages via:\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl.git\")'\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JOLI.jl.git\")'\nOnce Devito, SegyIO and JOLI are installed, you can install JUDI with Julia’s Pkg.add.\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl\")'\nOnce you have JUDI installed, you need to point Julia’s PyCall package to the Python version for which we previously installed Devito. To do this, copy-paste the following commands into the (bash) terminal:\nexport PYTHON=$(which python)\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(\"PyCall\")'\nAgain, try which python3 if which python does not work.\nYou can verify your installation by running:\njulia -e 'using Pkg; using JUDI; example=joinpath(dirname(pathof(JUDI)),\"..\",\"examples/scripts/modeling_basic_2D.jl\");include(example);'\nThis command should finish without errors.\n\n\n\nDocker is a platform which builds a virtual machine/container for you in case some softwares above cannot be installed/processed in the environment on your local machine. Thus, we suggest you first try to install the softwares above and do the programming exercises on your local machine. The exercises should work well in apple/linux machines.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this exercise we will load some data into Julia and perform some basic operations.\nSeismic data are typically stored in a special binary format: SEGY. These file-formats store the data as mutliple time-series (traces) with the corresponding header information containing specific information about such as time sampling and source/receiver locations.\nThe Julia utilities for reading SEGY data is SegyIO\n\nusing Pkg\n#Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl.git\")\n#Pkg.add(\"PyPlot\")\nusing SegyIO, PyPlot\n\n\nScaning the dataset\nThhe first step is to scan the dataset to extract header/metadat. This metadat contains the geometry and parameters of the survey such as the source/receiver locations and time sampling rate. The convention for the metadata is as follows:\nThe Source positions use the Source keyword such as SourceX\nThe receiver position use the Group keyword such as GroupX\n\n# scan the dataset\n\ndir = Pkg.dir(\"SegyIO\")\ndata_dir = \"data\"\n\n┌ Warning: `Pkg.dir(pkgname, paths...)` is deprecated; instead, do `import SegyIO; joinpath(dirname(pathof(SegyIO)), \"..\", paths...)`.\n└ @ Pkg.API /buildworker/worker/package_linux64/build/usr/share/julia/stdlib/v1.2/Pkg/src/API.jl:415\n\n\n\"data\"\n\n\nWe can now scans the dataset with the segy_scan functin. This function returns a SeisCOn object where each block is a shot record with its metadata.\n\nblocks = segy_scan(string(dir, data_dir), \"overthrust\", [\"GroupX\", \"GroupY\", \"ns\", \"dt\"]);\n\nScanning ... /home/yzhang3198/.julia/packages/SegyIO/ak2qG/data/overthrust_2D_shot_41_60.segy\nScanning ... /home/yzhang3198/.julia/packages/SegyIO/ak2qG/data/overthrust_2D_shot_21_40.segy\nScanning ... /home/yzhang3198/.julia/packages/SegyIO/ak2qG/data/overthrust_2D_shot_61_80.segy\nScanning ... /home/yzhang3198/.julia/packages/SegyIO/ak2qG/data/overthrust_2D_shot_1_20.segy\nScanning ... /home/yzhang3198/.julia/packages/SegyIO/ak2qG/data/overthrust_2D_shot_81_97.segy\n\n\nNow extract the time, source and receiver coordinates (in seconds and meters) for all the traces. The source and receiver vectors have a length equal to the number of traces, the time vector has a length equal to the number of rows in the data matrix.\n\nsx = [get_header(blocks[i], \"SourceX\") for i=1:length(blocks)];\nrx = [get_header(blocks[i], \"GroupX\") for i=1:length(blocks)];\n\n\n# Get the tme axis. In this case the time axis is the same for all traces so we only need to extract it from the first trace\n# dt needs to be corrected for the binary setup\n# All the times are in ms\ndt = get_header(blocks[1], \"dt\")[1]/1000\nnt = get_header(blocks[1], \"ns\")[1]\nT = 0:dt:(nt-1)*dt\n\n0.0:4.0:3000.0\n\n\nCalculate the offset and midpoint for each trace. This gives you vectors m (midpoint) and h (offset) with length equal to the number of traces.\nh = (s - r)/2;\nm = (s + r)/2;\n\nh = (sx .- rx)./2;\nm = (sx .+ rx)./2;\n\nThe fold of the data is the number of traces in each midpoint gather. This can be easily visualized by a histogram. As we have a set of blocks we need to inspect each block seperately to recover the nuique set of midpoint location and the total number fo traces for this midpoint\n\nall_m = hcat(m'...)\nfold = [sum(all_m .== unique(all_m)[i]) for i=1:length(unique(all_m))];\n\nall_h = hcat(h'...);\n\n\nfigure();\nbar(unique(all_m),fold ,align=\"center\", width=100);\nxlabel(\"midpoint [m]\");\nylabel(\"fold\");\ntitle(\"fold\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you interpret this figure?\nDifferent gathers\nExtract a midpoint gather. For example, a midpoint gather at m = 2550 looks like this:\n\nIm = findall(all_m .== 7500.)\nfigure()\nimshow(Float32.(blocks[1:97].data[:,map(i -&gt; i[2], Im)]), vmin=-1, vmax=1, cmap=\"Greys\", aspect=0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPyObject &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x7f49363d4e48&gt;\n\n\nExtract an offset-gather. For example, a zero-offset section looks like:\n\nIh = findall(all_h .== 0.)\ninds = sortperm(all_m[Ih])\nfigure()\nimshow(Float32.(blocks[1:97].data[:,map(i -&gt; i[2], Ih[inds])]), vmin=-1, vmax=1, cmap=\"Greys\", aspect=.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPyObject &lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x7f4935b5f860&gt;\n\n\nWhat other different gathers can you think of? Extract and plot an example of all the different gathers. What are characteristic properties of the different gathers? Do not forget to label the axis and choose a reasonable colorscale. Hint: use cmap=Greys and adjust the color-axis vmin/vmax\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

One way to judge flatness of an event is via the stackpower.

Organize the resulting NMO velocities in a matrix Vm (where column i is the NMO velocity for midpoint xm[i]) interpolate the results to obtain a velocity for all the midpoints using Spline1D(xm, VM); spl(all_m). Plot the velocity and discuss.\nUsing this NMO velocity, we can produce an NMO stack. Perform an NMO correction of all the midpoint gathers using the corresponding NMO velocity derived above and sum each along the offset direction. Organize all the stacks in a matrix and plot the result. Also make a stack using a constant NMO velocity. Discuss the results.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUsing AI-powered coding tools and agents: Use of tools such as Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot is permitted, but you must abide by the following principles:\n\nDisclosure (required): If you used a generative AI tool for any part of an assignment or project, include an AI Usage Statement in your report/README that names the tool(s) and briefly describes what you used them for (e.g., debugging, drafting, test generation, refactoring).\nProvenance (required): Maintain a prompt/interaction log (e.g., PROMPTS.md or a prompts/ folder) and commit it to your GitHub repository. Commits should reflect meaningful iterations and should reference prompt IDs or excerpts so the evolution of your work can be audited.\nAccountability (required): You are responsible for everything you submit. You must be able to explain your code and results, reproduce your experiments, and verify any factual claims or citations. You may be asked to walk through your work (code, derivations, and/or experiments).\nSpec-driven workflow: For the final project, you must use a specification-driven workflow (e.g., spec-kit, agent-os, or cc-sdd, or an equivalent workflow that includes a written spec and acceptance tests). For labs, this is strongly encouraged.\nPrivacy, IP, and licensing: Do not paste confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data into external AI services. Ensure you comply with software licensing and provide attribution where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral guidance on the use of Generative AI\nAI-based assistance (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and coding agents) can be a useful study and software-development aid in this course. You may use these tools to support learning the lecture/textbook material and to help develop your ideas for proposals, labs, and the final project. However, these tools do not replace your responsibility for independent work, correctness, and academic integrity.\n\nRequired documentation when you use Generative AI (applies to labs and the final project)\nIf you used generative AI for any part of your work, your submission must include:\n\nAI Usage Statement (in your report/README): tool name(s) + what you used them for + what you independently verified.\nPrompt/interaction log (in your GitHub repo): e.g., PROMPTS.md or a prompts/ folder (redact anything sensitive).\nVerification evidence (in your repo): tests, sanity checks, references to derivations, or short notes describing how you validated AI-assisted outputs.\n\nExample AI Usage Statement (you may copy/adapt):\n\nDisclosure: I used generative AI tools (tool names and versions, if known) to support portions of this assignment (briefly describe: e.g., brainstorming, debugging, refactoring, drafting). I curated prompts, reviewed and edited all outputs, verified factual statements and citations, and take full responsibility for the final submission. A prompt/provenance record is included in the repository.\n\n\n\nGenerating research ideas or approaches\n\nBrainstorming: You can use an AI tool as a brainstorming partner. Treat it as an iterative process—try multiple prompts, request alternatives, and compare suggestions.\nSurveying existing approaches: AI tools can provide an initial overview of methods or literature, but you must verify claims and consult authoritative sources (papers, textbooks, and library/professional-society databases).\nPrompting skill matters: The value of the output depends on the quality of the prompt. Keep prompts specific, include constraints, and document the versions you tried.\n\n\n\nAllowed uses (examples)\n\nExplaining error messages, suggesting debugging strategies, or proposing minimal reproducible examples.\nGenerating unit tests, docstrings, documentation, or refactoring suggestions that you then review and validate.\nBrainstorming model/design choices, experiment plans, ablations, and evaluation criteria.\nDrafting pseudocode or outlines that you then implement and verify yourself.\n\n\n\nNot allowed uses (examples)\n\nSubmitting AI-generated code, text, figures, results, or citations that you cannot explain or reproduce.\nUsing AI to fabricate citations, data, experiments, or results (all citations must be verifiable).\nUsing AI to generate a complete solution and only lightly paraphrasing/editing it as your own work.\nSharing private course materials or other students’ work with an external AI tool, or pasting others’ code/text into a prompt.\n\n\n\nAdvice on usage\n\nBe critical: Do not trust any output you cannot independently evaluate or trace back to credible sources.\nBe scientific with prompts: Prompting is not deterministic; small changes can yield different answers. Keep records and compare outputs across prompt variants.\nProtect privacy and IP: Do not share confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information (including personally identifiable information) with external AI services. Treat prompts and uploads as potentially non-private. If you intend to pursue commercialization or other Intellectual Property avenues, uploading information to an open AI platform may constitute disclosure.\n\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nCampus Resources for Students\nLinks to Campus Resources for Students — e.g. Center for Academic Success, Communication Center, Office of Disability Services, OMED, Division of Student Life, etc. available at: https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/d/4626/files/2025/07/campus_resources_students.pdf\n\nQuick Guide on Student Mental Health and Wellness Resources:\nThe Center for Mental Health Care & Resources is here to offer confidential support and services to students in need of mental health care. During regular business hours, students who are not actively in counseling may call 404-894-2575 or walk-in to the office , 353 Ferst DR NW Atlanta GA 30313 (Flag building next to the Student Center). Any time outside of business hours, students may call 404-894-2575 and select the option to speak to the after-hours counselor.\n\n\nAdditional On Campus Options\nStudents who are experiencing an immediate life-threatening emergency on campus, can call the Georgia Tech Campus Police at 404-894-2500\n\n\nLocal and National crisis resources available 24/7:\n\nCrisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741 https://www.crisistextline.org/\nGeorgia Crisis & Access Line: Call 1-800-715-4225\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: Call 988 or 1-800-273-8255, or access text chat here https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/\n\n\n\nAdditional services offered by Satellite counselors’ (walk-in consultation hours):\nEach Satellite counselor provides weekly consultation appointments at varying times based on their schedules (see highlighted section below for my Fall ’23 hours). Anyone can access a Satellite counselor during these times, to set up a consultation email is preferable, once a message is received the Satellite counselor will reply with available dates/times and a link. Some Satellite counselors will accommodate in-person walk-ins at these times as well.\n\nWhat it is\n\nConsulting about a brief, non-emergency concern during the counselor’s posted walk-in consultation hours (similar to Let’s Talk). Consultations are approximately 15 minutes.\nProviding information to students about mental health resources on campus and how to get connected\nConsulting with faculty/staff about a student of concern\n\n\n\nWhat it isn’t\n\nNot for a walk-in counseling appointment or initial assessment\nNot for students who are seeking support in their counselor’s absence. Students who need additional/urgent support when their counselor is unavailable should visit the Center for Mental Health Care & Resources\nNot for crisis\nNot for case management\n\nTara Holdampf, MS, LPC, (she/her), Satellite Counselor’s Consultation Hours for the College of Sciences: Please email tara.holdampf@studentlife.gatech.edu for an appointment, or stop by my Office Location: MoSE 1120B.
