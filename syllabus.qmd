## Activities & Assessment

### Exams 

There will be a midterm (25%) and a final exam (25%). Both of them are closed book. Reference to texts or other documents such as previous semester course materials during exams is strictly forbidden. Using these materials will be considered a direct violation of academic policy and will be dealt with according to the GT Academic Honor Code. The use of electronic devices (e.g. cellular phones, computers etc.) other than non-programmable calculators during exams and quizzes is not allowed. 

### Computational Assignments

Details on the assignments will be provided on a lecture by lecture basis following this [Schedule](schedule.qmd). These assignments will mostly involve Digital Twin-related programs, computer simulations, and data analysis. These assignments are designed for each student to work one by him/herself. Collaboration is to a reasonable degree encouraged. During these assignments, you will apply concepts discussed during lectures, with a focus on the computational aspects. These assignments will count towards 35% of your overall course grade. There are about ten computational assignments planned for the term. 

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

## Course policies

### Academic honesty

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

-   **Using AI-powered coding tools and agents**: Use of tools such as Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot is permitted, but you must abide by the following principles:
    -   **Disclosure (required)**: If you used a generative AI tool for any part of an assignment or project, include an *AI Usage Statement* in your report/README that names the tool(s) and briefly describes what you used them for (e.g., debugging, drafting, test generation, refactoring).
    -   **Provenance (required)**: Maintain a prompt/interaction log (e.g., `PROMPTS.md` or a `prompts/` folder) and commit it to your GitHub repository. Commits should reflect meaningful iterations and should reference prompt IDs or excerpts so the evolution of your work can be audited.
    -   **Accountability (required)**: You are responsible for everything you submit. You must be able to explain your code and results, reproduce your experiments, and verify any factual claims or citations. You may be asked to walk through your work (code, derivations, and/or experiments).
    -   **Spec-driven workflow**: For the final project, you must use a specification-driven workflow (e.g., [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), [agent-os](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os), or [cc-sdd](https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd), or an equivalent workflow that includes a written spec and acceptance tests). For labs, this is strongly encouraged.
    -   **Privacy, IP, and licensing**: Do not paste confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data into external AI services. Ensure you comply with software licensing and provide attribution where appropriate.

### General guidance on the use of Generative AI

AI-based assistance (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and coding agents) can be a useful *study* and *software-development* aid in this course. You may use these tools to support learning the lecture/textbook material and to help develop your ideas for proposals, labs, and the final project. However, these tools do not replace your responsibility for independent work, correctness, and academic integrity.

#### Required documentation when you use Generative AI (applies to labs and the final project)

If you used generative AI for any part of your work, your submission must include:

-   **AI Usage Statement** (in your report/README): tool name(s) + what you used them for + what you independently verified.
-   **Prompt/interaction log** (in your GitHub repo): e.g., `PROMPTS.md` or a `prompts/` folder (redact anything sensitive).
-   **Verification evidence** (in your repo): tests, sanity checks, references to derivations, or short notes describing how you validated AI-assisted outputs.

Example AI Usage Statement (you may copy/adapt):

> *Disclosure: I used generative AI tools (tool names and versions, if known) to support portions of this assignment (briefly describe: e.g., brainstorming, debugging, refactoring, drafting). I curated prompts, reviewed and edited all outputs, verified factual statements and citations, and take full responsibility for the final submission. A prompt/provenance record is included in the repository.*

#### Generating research ideas or approaches

-   **Brainstorming**: You can use an AI tool as a brainstorming partner. Treat it as an iterative process—try multiple prompts, request alternatives, and compare suggestions.
-   **Surveying existing approaches**: AI tools can provide an initial overview of methods or literature, but you must verify claims and consult authoritative sources (papers, textbooks, and library/professional-society databases).
-   **Prompting skill matters**: The value of the output depends on the quality of the prompt. Keep prompts specific, include constraints, and document the versions you tried.

#### Allowed uses (examples)

-   Explaining error messages, suggesting debugging strategies, or proposing minimal reproducible examples.
-   Generating unit tests, docstrings, documentation, or refactoring suggestions that you then review and validate.
-   Brainstorming model/design choices, experiment plans, ablations, and evaluation criteria.
-   Drafting pseudocode or outlines that you then implement and verify yourself.

#### Not allowed uses (examples)

-   Submitting AI-generated code, text, figures, results, or citations that you cannot explain or reproduce.
-   Using AI to fabricate citations, data, experiments, or results (all citations must be verifiable).
-   Using AI to generate a complete solution and only lightly paraphrasing/editing it as your own work.
-   Sharing private course materials or other students' work with an external AI tool, or pasting others' code/text into a prompt.

#### Advice on usage

-   **Be critical**: Do not trust any output you cannot independently evaluate or trace back to credible sources.
-   **Be scientific with prompts**: Prompting is not deterministic; small changes can yield different answers. Keep records and compare outputs across prompt variants.
-   **Protect privacy and IP**: Do not share confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information (including personally identifiable information) with external AI services. Treat prompts and uploads as potentially non-private. If you intend to pursue commercialization or other Intellectual Property avenues, uploading information to an open AI platform may constitute disclosure.

### Late work & extensions

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignments will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.

-   Providing information to students about mental health resources on campus and how to get connected
-   Consulting with faculty/staff about a student of concern

##### What it isn't

-   Not for a walk-in counseling appointment or initial assessment
-   Not for students who are seeking support in their counselor's absence. Students who need additional/urgent support when their counselor is unavailable should visit the Center for Mental Health Care & Resources
-   Not for crisis
-   Not for case management
